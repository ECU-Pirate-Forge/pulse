Classroom Pulse & Feedback System

A real-time classroom feedback tool that lets faculty instantly send questions to students during class and collect anonymous responses. It exists to help instructors gauge student understanding on the fly and adjust their teaching without disrupting the flow of class.

Features:

Real-time pulse questions — Faculty send questions instantly and see live results as students respond
Anonymous responses with blinded results — Students answer honestly without seeing peer responses until the instructor chooses to reveal them
AI-assisted question generation — AI helps faculty quickly create effective questions across multiple formats including multiple choice, Likert-scale, and open-ended
Cross-platform access — Works on both mobile and desktop browsers with a shared backend
Session management & data storage — Questions are tied to specific class sessions and saved for reuse in future classes
